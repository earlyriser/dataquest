## 1. Recap ##

import pandas as pd
loans = pd.read_csv("cleaned_loans_2007.csv")
print(loans.info())

## 3. Picking an error metric ##

import pandas as pd

filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
tn = len(predictions[filter])

filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
tp = len(predictions[filter])

filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
fn = len(predictions[filter])

filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
fp = len(predictions[filter])

## 5. Class imbalance ##

import pandas as pd
import numpy

# Predict that all loans will be paid off on time.
predictions = pd.Series(numpy.ones(loans.shape[0]))

# False positives.
fp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
fp = len(predictions[fp_filter])

# True positives.
tp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
tp = len(predictions[tp_filter])

# False negatives.
fn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
fn = len(predictions[fn_filter])

# True negatives
tn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
tn = len(predictions[tn_filter])

fpr = fp / (fp + tn)
tpr = tp / (tp + fn)

print ("fpr", fpr)
print ("tpr", tpr)

## 6. Logistic Regression ##

# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
lr = LogisticRegression()

cols = loans.columns
train_cols = cols.drop("loan_status")
features = loans[train_cols]
target = loans["loan_status"]

lr.fit(features, target)
predictions = lr.predict(features)

## 7. Cross Validation ##

# CROSS VALIDATION
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_predict, KFold
lr = LogisticRegression()
kf = KFold(features.shape[0], random_state=1)

predictions = cross_val_predict(lr, features, target, cv=kf)
predictions = pd.Series(predictions)

# False positives.
fp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
fp = len(predictions[fp_filter])

# True positives.
tp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
tp = len(predictions[tp_filter])

# False negatives.
fn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
fn = len(predictions[fn_filter])

# True negatives
tn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
tn = len(predictions[tn_filter])

# Rates
tpr = tp / (tp + fn)
fpr = fp / (fp + tn)

print(tpr)
print(fpr)

## 9. Penalizing the classifier ##

# CROSS VALIDATION
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_predict, KFold

lr = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')
kf = KFold(features.shape[0], random_state=1)

predictions = cross_val_predict(lr, features, target, cv=kf)
predictions = pd.Series(predictions)

# False positives.
fp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
fp = len(predictions[fp_filter])

# True positives.
tp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
tp = len(predictions[tp_filter])

# False negatives.
fn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
fn = len(predictions[fn_filter])

# True negatives
tn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
tn = len(predictions[tn_filter])

# Rates
tpr = tp / (tp + fn)
fpr = fp / (fp + tn)

print(tpr)
print(fpr)

## 10. Manual penalties ##

# CROSS VALIDATION
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_predict, KFold

penalty = {
    0: 10,
    1: 1
}

lr = LogisticRegression(class_weight=penalty)
kf = KFold(features.shape[0], random_state=1)

predictions = cross_val_predict(lr, features, target, cv=kf)
predictions = pd.Series(predictions)

# False positives.
fp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
fp = len(predictions[fp_filter])

# True positives.
tp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
tp = len(predictions[tp_filter])

# False negatives.
fn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 1)
fn = len(predictions[fn_filter])

# True negatives
tn_filter = (predictions == 0) & (loans["loan_status"] == 0)
tn = len(predictions[tn_filter])

# Rates
tpr = tp / (tp + fn)
fpr = fp / (fp + tn)

print(tpr)
print(fpr)

## 11. Random forests ##

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_predict
